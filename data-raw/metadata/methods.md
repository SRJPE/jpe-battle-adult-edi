# Upstream Passage

*Objectives:* 

*Type:* Video monitoring and trap 

*Location:* Coleman National Fish Hatchery Barrier Weir 

*Times of operation:* March-November 


Battle Creek collects two types of adult upstream passage data: trap and video monitoring data. The video system and trap are located at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery Barrier Weir and are operated between March and November.

Video footage is collected using a video vault and reviewed manually by monitoring crews. Information collected includes date, time, video condition, fish count, species, run, fin clip status, passage direction, and occasional comments are associated with a record. Chinook or rainbow trout footage is reviewed by a second more experienced personnel for quality and accuracy. Total hours of video footage and total hours of fish passage are recorded to understand Video efficiency. Missing data is interpolated using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Run assignment of chinook salmon is recorded based on date of passage observation. Some limitations of the video system and passage estimates based on the video system include turbidity visibility challenges, run determination by date inaccuracies, video outages in high flow years, and GAM model performance when there are low counts or uneven daily counts.
Monitoring crews conduct trapping seven days a week on Battle Creek using a false bottom trap located at the top of the fish ladder. Trapping is only conducted when temperatures are below 60 degrees, and the trap is checked every 30 minutes during trapping. The following attributes are collected for any fish caught in the trap: fork length, marks or tags, sex, fish health, adipose fin status. Tags are removed from any CWT hatchery fish to collect information on that fish. All monitoring data is collected manually in the field and entered into a digital format by hand.

# Redd

*Objectives:* Estimate spawning population 

*Type:* Multiple surveys per year 

*Location:* 18.6 miles are sampled in each survey. The survey starts at the upstream end of the reach and it typically takes 4 days to survey the entire reach. 

*Times of operation:*

Snorkel surveys began in 2001 on Battle Creek. Typically three snorkel surveys are performed each year. 18.6 miles are sampled in each survey. The survey starts at the upstream end of the reach and it typically takes 4 days to survey the entire reach. Three snorkelers swim perpendicular to the flow and count holding Chinook, carcasses and redds. Data displayed below are filtered to Spring Run and reaches 6 & 7 are excluded because they primarily contain Fall or Late Fall Run populations. Holding and carcass data are not currently available in this package.

When redds are encountered on a snorkel survey, crews collect additional data on the redds: date, latitude, longitude, reach, river mile, fish guarding, year, species, run, redd substrate class, tail substrate class, and pre-redd substrate class. Less consistently, Battle Creek also collects redd width and length as well as velocity. Redd data is used to determine the spawning window. Redd data is considered an accurate count of the spawning population. Redd data most accurately counts total spawning population in years with fewer redds and is a less reliable measure in years with large spawning populations.
