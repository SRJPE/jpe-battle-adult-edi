    <abstract>
      <para>
    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) collects data on adult
    salmonids on Battle Creek. Data are collected via snorkel surveys,
    video camera systems, and a trap at the spawning building. Snorkel
    surveys are conducted annually, and video camera systems operate 24
    hours a day, 7 days a week when the trap is not operating due to
    temperature constraints. Data from this monitoring are used to
    estimate adult escapement (upstream passage) abundance and timing,
    spawner abundance, and other important metrics for adult salmonids
    in the watershed. These data will also be used to inform the
    development of a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run
    Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed.

      Battle Creek collects two types of adult upstream passage data:
      trap and video monitoring data. The video system and trap are
      located at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery Barrier Weir and are
      operated between March and November.
    </para>
            <para>
      Video footage is collected using a video vault and reviewed
      manually by monitoring crews. Information collected includes date,
      time, video condition, fish count, species, run, fin clip status,
      passage direction, and occasional comments are associated with a
      record. Chinook or rainbow trout footage is reviewed by a second,
      more experienced, personnel for quality and accuracy. Total hours
      of video footage and total hours of fish passage are recorded to
      understand video efficiency. A Cormack Jolly-Seber (CJS) model is
      applied to the video passage data. Run assignment of chinook
      salmon is recorded based on date of passage observation. Some
      limitations of the video system and passage estimates based on the
      video system include turbidity visibility challenges, run
      determination by date inaccuracies, video outages in high flow
      years, and CJS model performance when there are low counts or
      uneven daily counts. Monitoring crews conduct sampling in the
      spawning building, where a false bottom trap is located at the top
      of the fish ladder. This sampling occurs in two phases: from March
      1st through April, the trap is sampled once per every 24 hour
      period, five days a week. From April onward, the trap is sampled
      once per every 24 hour period, seven days a week, until water
      temperature limits are reached. Trapping is only conducted when
      water temperatures are below 68 degrees, and the trap is checked
      every 30 minutes during trapping. The following attributes are
      collected for any fish caught in the trap: fork length, marks or
      tags, sex, fish health, adipose fin status. Tags are removed from
      any CWT hatchery fish to collect information on that fish. All
      monitoring data is collected manually in the field and entered
      into a digital format by hand.

            <para>
      Snorkel surveys began in 2001 on Battle Creek. Usually three
      snorkel surveys are performed each year. 18.6 miles are sampled in
      each survey period: the sample area spans from the South Fork of
      Battle Creek starting at Coleman Dam, North Fork of Battle Creek
      starting at Trout Farm location (start of R1B) (historically
      starting at Eagle Canyon Dam), the mainstem of Battle Creek from
      the NF/SF confluence down to the confluence with the Sacramento
      River (end of R7)(end of R6 is Coleman National Fish Hatchery).
      The survey starts at the upstream end of the sample area and
      surveying the entire sample area typically takes four days to a
      week. Three snorkelers swim perpendicular to the flow and count
      holding Chinook, carcasses and redds. Data displayed below are
      filtered to Spring Run and reaches 6 &amp; 7 are excluded because
      they primarily contain Fall or Late Fall Run populations. Holding
      and carcass data are not currently available in this package.
    </para>
            <para>
      When redds are encountered on a snorkel survey, crews collect
      additional data on the redds: date, latitude, longitude, reach,
      river mile, fish guarding, year, species, run, redd substrate
      class, tail substrate class, and pre-redd substrate class. Less
      consistently, Battle Creek also collects redd width and length as
      well as velocity. Redd data is used to determine the spawning
      window. Redd data is considered an accurate count of the spawning
      population. Redd data most accurately counts total spawning
      population in years with fewer redds and is a less reliable
      measure in years with large spawning populations.
    </para>
            <para>
      Redds are assigned a unique redd ID upon observation. If a redd is
      observed more than once, it may be assigned an age, and that redd
      ID may have multiple observations in a table.
    </para>
            <para>
      Methods for measuring substrate size has varied over the years and
      for this package, substrate class was standardized using the
      Wentworth scale, created by W.C. Krumbein. This scale is what is
      commonly used in the United States. When the size range fell into
      two categories, they were rounded down. The scale, in descending
      size order, is boulder (&gt;256mm), cobble (64-256mm), very coarse
      gravel (32-64mm), coarse gravel (16-32mm), medium gravel (8-16mm),
      fine gravel (4-8mm), very fine gravel (2-4mm), very coarse sand
      (1-2mm), coarse sand (0.5-1mm), medium sand (0.25-0.5mm), fine
      sand – clay (&lt;0.25mm).
